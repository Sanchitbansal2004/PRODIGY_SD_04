# PRODIGY_SD_04
The Sudoku solver uses a backtracking algorithm, which is a depth-first search algorithm that attempts to fill the board one cell at a time. 
If it encounters a conflict, it backtracks and tries a different number. This process continues until the puzzle is solved or no solution is possible.
Algorithm Steps:
Find Empty Cells: Locate the next empty cell in the Sudoku grid.
Try Possible Numbers: For each empty cell, attempt to place each number from 1 to 9.
Check for Conflicts: After placing a number, check if it violates the Sudoku rules (each number must be unique in its row, column, and 3x3 subgrid).
Backtrack if Needed: If a conflict is detected, backtrack and try the next number.
Repeat: Continue this process until the puzzle is solved or no solution is found.
